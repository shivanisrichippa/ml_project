Breast Cancer Detection Project
Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The model distinguishes between malignant and benign tumors, achieving an accuracy rate of 89%.

Dataset
The dataset contains 569 samples with 30 features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast mass tissue.
